# Jquery-Bobblehead
Jquery Bobblehead

This was a side project at the office to create a web based bobble head doll based on picutres of a real bobblehead created of the CEO.
This project is based on an article by Alex Fierro on the Rusty Brick Blog in 2011 -> https://www.rustybrick.com/creating-a-jquery-bobblehead.html
Later I decided to see if I could make it say company goals in a cartoon bubble. This was based on the TransformJS library.
